Random Characters for Android

Generates a random string and copies it to the Android clipboard, as well as displays it in a short Toast popup.  The format "[abcdefgh] " is 8 random lowercase characters, surrounded by square brackets and a trailing space.

Use it for attaching a random tag to things.  A new tag is generated every time the app is run.
